- User acceptance criteria are satisfied
- No critical or high-priority bugs remain open

## Task 3: Simulate Development and Testing

### Introduced Bugs (Development Simulation)

**Bug 1: Order of Operations Not Implemented**
- Description: Calculator processes operations left-to-right instead of following mathematical precedence
- Example: 2+3×4 returns 20 instead of 14

**Bug 2: Large Number Overflow**
- Description: Calculator crashes when handling very large numbers instead of showing error
- Example: 999999999 × 999999999 causes application crash

**Bug 3: Floating Point Precision Error**
- Description: Inconsistent rounding leads to incorrect results
- Example: 0.1 + 0.2 displays as 0.30000000000000004

**Bug 4: Negative Square Root Allows Calculation**
- Description: Calculator attempts to calculate square root of negative numbers
- Example: √(-4) returns NaN instead of error message

## Task 4: Reflect and Discuss (Release Readiness)

### Analysis Questions

**Were all initially defined requirements covered by test cases?**
- Most functional requirements were covered, but some edge cases were missed
- The intentionally omitted requirements (order of operations, large numbers, negative number UI) led to gaps in test coverage
- This highlights the importance of thorough requirements gathering

**Did testing uncover bugs related to omitted requirements?**
- Partially - the large number overflow bug was discovered through boundary testing
- However, order of operations issues weren't caught because we didn't write test cases for complex expressions
- This demonstrates how incomplete requirements directly lead to insufficient test coverage

**Release Readiness Decision**
- **Current Status**: NOT READY for release
- **Critical Issues**: Application crashes (BUG-002) must be fixed
- **Required Actions**: 
  - Fix all high and critical priority bugs
  - Add missing requirements and corresponding test cases
  - Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Conduct additional testing for edge cases

**Risks of Releasing with Known Defects**
- **User Experience**: Poor user experience due to crashes and incorrect results
- **Reputation**: Damage to brand reputation from unreliable software
- **Support Costs**: Increased customer support burden
- **Legal/Compliance**: Potential issues if calculator is used in critical applications

**Value of Requirement Traceability**
- Helped identify which requirements were adequately tested
- Revealed gaps in test coverage
- Enabled systematic approach to testing
- Facilitated impact analysis when bugs were found
- Provided clear mapping between business needs and technical validation

### Recommendations

1. **Complete Requirements Engineering**: Add missing requirements for order of operations and large number handling
2. **Expand Test Coverage**: Create additional test cases for complex expressions and edge cases
3. **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Ensure all error conditions are gracefully handled
4. **Performance Testing**: Conduct thorough performance testing under various conditions
5. **User Acceptance Testing**: Involve end users in testing to validate usability requirements

### Conclusion

This exercise demonstrates that achieving "bug-free" software requires:
- Comprehensive requirements engineering
- Systematic test planning with traceability
- Thorough testing including edge cases
- Proper error handling and validation
- Clear definition of release criteria

The "perfect calculator" remains imperfect, highlighting that software quality is an ongoing process requiring continuous attention to requirements, testing, and user feedback.
